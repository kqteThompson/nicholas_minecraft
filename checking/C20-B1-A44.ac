 0 : Builder_B1 : Mission has started. 1 : Builder_B1 : hello 2 : Architect_A44 : ok this one is not 2 dimensional so its gonna be a bit challenging 3 : Builder_B1 : got it 4 : Architect_A44 : but lets start with a 2 dimensional 2 column drawing anyways 5 : Architect_A44 : red, empty, yellow 6 : Builder_B1 : anywhere? 7 : Architect_A44 : anywhere 8 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-5] 9 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:2 Z:-5] 10 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:3 Z:-5] 11 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:5 Y:2 Z:-5] 12 : Architect_A44 : ok I take that back place it in the middle 13 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:5 Y:3 Z:-5] 14 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-5] 15 : Builder_B1 : ok 16 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1] 17 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1] 18 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1] 19 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1] 20 : Architect_A44 : 2nd column: empty, orange 21 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 22 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1] 23 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 24 : Architect_A44 : ok allow me some time to think of instructions 25 : Builder_B1 : it might be easier to describe all one color? 26 : Builder_B1 : then build from there? 27 : Architect_A44 : ok lets finish up the yellows then 28 : Architect_A44 : place one yellow a column to the right of the orange block, 1 space higher, and 1 space further back 29 : Builder_B1 : back meaning away? 30 : Builder_B1 : or towards me? 31 : Architect_A44 : into the page 32 : Architect_A44 : lol 33 : Architect_A44 : away yes 34 : Builder_B1 : away? 35 : Builder_B1 : ok 36 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1] 37 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1] 38 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1] 39 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1] 40 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0] 41 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1] 42 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1] 43 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1] 44 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1] 45 : Builder_B1 : here? 46 : Architect_A44 : ok that's it 47 : Architect_A44 : ok lets do greens now 48 : Architect_A44 : place 1 green block a single space behind, and a single space above the yellow block you just placed 49 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0] 50 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1] 51 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0] 52 : Architect_A44 : yep 53 : Builder_B1 : here? 54 : Architect_A44 : if you could return to the front of the structure every time, it wouldh elp with the instructions I think 55 : Architect_A44 : the other green block is 3 spaces to the left and 1 space up of the last yellow block you placed 56 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 57 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0] 58 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0] 59 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0] 60 : Architect_A44 : yep 61 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0] 62 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0] 63 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 64 : Architect_A44 : ok we're done with greens lets do blue 65 : Architect_A44 : thers a blue block 1 space above and 1 space away from the last green block you placed 66 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:5 Z:0] 67 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:5 Z:1] 68 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:5 Z:0] 69 : Builder_B1 : here? 70 : Architect_A44 : yes 71 : Architect_A44 : the other blue block is 1 space to the left, 1 space up, 1 space behind the first green block you placed 72 : Architect_A44 : the left green block* 73 : Builder_B1 : diagonal step? 74 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:1] 75 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:2] 76 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:2] 77 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:2] 78 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:1] 79 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1] 80 : Architect_A44 : remove that last blue one 81 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1] 82 : Architect_A44 : ok last is purple 83 : Architect_A44 : place a purple 1 space left, 1 space up of the last blue block you placed 84 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:2] 85 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:6 Z:2] 86 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:2] 87 : Architect_A44 : ok we're done 88 : Builder_B1 : left step? 89 : Architect_A44 : would you like for me to start using those terms? 90 : Builder_B1 : just to confirm 91 : Architect_A44 : ah ok
