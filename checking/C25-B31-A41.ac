 0 : Builder_B31 : Mission has started. 1 : Architect_A41 : Okay, first make two purple blocks next to each other on the ground, in the middle of the environment. 2 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0] 3 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1] 4 : Builder_B31 : like this? 5 : Architect_A41 : Yes looks good. Now stack blocks so it's a tower seven blocks high. 6 : Builder_B31 : Purple blocks? 7 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0] 8 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 9 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0] 10 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0] 11 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:0] 12 : Architect_A41 : Yep, purple. So a tower 2 blocks wide and seven tall 13 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:7 Z:0] 14 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1] 15 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1] 16 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1] 17 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1] 18 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:7 Z:1] 19 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:1] 20 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:2] 21 : Architect_A41 : Okay great. And actually remove the bottom row of blocks. 22 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1] 23 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0] 24 : Architect_A41 : And now remove the three blocks below the top block on one side. 25 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:0] 26 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0] 27 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0] 28 : Architect_A41 : Great! 29 : Architect_A41 : Now put down two blue blocks on the ground, parallel to this purple structure, on the side with the gap. There should be a one block gap between the blue and purple. 30 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2] 31 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2] 32 : Architect_A41 : Hmm, should move the blue block closest to you so it is on the left side, away from the purple structure 33 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2] 34 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3] 35 : Builder_B31 : Like this? 36 : Architect_A41 : Perfect 37 : Architect_A41 : Okay now another row of two blue on top of that one 38 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2] 39 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-3] 40 : Architect_A41 : Now a stack of four blue blocks on the side closer to the purple 41 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2] 42 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-2] 43 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-2] 44 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-2] 45 : Architect_A41 : Great. Now one block on the same level as the top blue block, on the side toward the purple structure 46 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-3] 47 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-3] 48 : Architect_A41 : Also blue 49 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1] 50 : Architect_A41 : Perfect, that's it!
