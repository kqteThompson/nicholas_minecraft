 0 : Builder_B29 : Mission has started . 1 : Architect_A26 : We 'll start with a diagonal on the ground of 4 yellow bricks 2 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:1] 3 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0] 4 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 5 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2] 6 : Architect_A26 : Now add 3 red bricks on the diagonal adjacent to the yellow bricks 7 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1] 8 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0] 9 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1] 10 : Architect_A26 : Then add one more layer of red bricks 11 : Builder_B29 : above ? 12 : Architect_A26 : On top of the red ones 13 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1] 14 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0] 15 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1] 16 : Architect_A26 : Great ! Proceed to do the same thing with green bricks on the other side of the diagonal 17 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2] 18 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1] 19 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0] 20 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0] 21 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1] 22 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2] 23 : Architect_A26 : Now remove all of the red and green bricks on the first level 24 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2] 25 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1] 26 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0] 27 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1] 28 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0] 29 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1] 30 : Architect_A26 : please put a purple brick on top of the middle red brick 31 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 32 : Architect_A26 : Add a purple bricks adjacent to the purple bricks , away from the center of the object 33 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 34 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 35 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0] 36 : Builder_B29 : on a diagonal or line ? 37 : Architect_A26 : the last brick wil be in a diagonal 38 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0] 39 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0] 40 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1] 41 : Architect_A26 : So from the side of the object , you should see two yellow - red - purple diagonals The most recently placed brick is out of place 42 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1] 43 : Architect_A26 : it should be shifted one to its left 44 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1] 45 : Architect_A26 : Perfect ! There are now two yellow - red - purple diagonals . Add an orange brick to make them meet So there will be a yellow - red - purple - orange diagonal You 'll have to add and remove a brick to get the orange brick to float the orange brick will be one level above the purple layer , and lie in the empty space between the three purple bricks 46 : Builder_B29 : please tell me where the orange brick should be floating where I 'm standing 47 : Architect_A26 : Yes 48 : Builder_B29 : or floating 49 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0] 50 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:1] 51 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0] 52 : Architect_A26 : Awesome ! now remove the purple brick that is in the middle of the little L of purple bricks 53 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 54 : Architect_A26 : We 'll cap off the object by adding two bricks on the ground , touching the green bricks diagonally 55 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2] 56 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1] 57 : Architect_A26 : blue bricks 58 : Builder_B29 : like that ? 59 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2] 60 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1] 61 : Architect_A26 : yes ! 62 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2] 63 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1] 64 : Architect_A26 : Great work 65 : Builder_B29 : thank you
