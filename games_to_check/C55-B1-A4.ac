 0 : Builder_B1 : Mission has started. 1 : Builder_B1 : hello 2 : Architect_A4 : hi; this one is shitty 3 : Architect_A4 : start with yellow 4 : Architect_A4 : place one in the center of one of the lines near the edge 5 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:1 Z:0] 6 : Builder_B1 : here? 7 : Architect_A4 : yep 8 : Architect_A4 : now still on the flat surface place one above each of the diagonal corners 9 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:1 Z:1] 10 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-1] 11 : Builder_B1 : like a c? 12 : Architect_A4 : good; repeat to make a V 13 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1] 14 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:1] 15 : Architect_A4 : still diagonal from the previous squares 16 : Builder_B1 : extended? 17 : Builder_B1 : oh ok 18 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:1] 19 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:2] 20 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1] 21 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-2] 22 : Architect_A4 : good 23 : Architect_A4 : switch to orange 24 : Architect_A4 : now you're building a 3d staircase from the top of one of the sides of the V 25 : Architect_A4 : start on the flat surface 26 : Architect_A4 : one above the outer yellow block 27 : Architect_A4 : either side 28 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:5 Y:1 Z:1] 29 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:2] 30 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:5 Y:2 Z:1] 31 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:2 Z:2] 32 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:1 Z:3] 33 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:3] 34 : Architect_A4 : no delete ththose 35 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:3] 36 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:4 Y:2 Z:2] 37 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:2] 38 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:5 Y:2 Z:1] 39 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:5 Y:1 Z:1] 40 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:1 Z:3] 41 : Architect_A4 : stand at one of teh outer blocks 42 : Architect_A4 : put one in front of it 43 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:2] 44 : Architect_A4 : great 45 : Architect_A4 : now build a 3d staircase 46 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:2] 47 : Architect_A4 : diagonal slope 48 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:1 Z:1] 49 : Builder_B1 : here? 50 : Architect_A4 : jutting away from the V 51 : Builder_B1 : the first step is yellow right? 52 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:1] 53 : Architect_A4 : not really; the first step is orange, but it is in line with the yellow blocks 54 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:1] 55 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:1 Z:1] 56 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:2] 57 : Architect_A4 : okay build one more orange in front of that orange 58 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2] 59 : Architect_A4 : now one orange on top of teh second orange 60 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2] 61 : Architect_A4 : now delete the second orange 62 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2] 63 : Architect_A4 : good repeat to make a third step 64 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2] 65 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2] 66 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2] 67 : Builder_B1 : like this? 68 : Architect_A4 : now build that same structure on the other side of the V 69 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2] 70 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-2] 71 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-2] 72 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-2] 73 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2] 74 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2] 75 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2] 76 : Architect_A4 : well done 77 : Architect_A4 : switch to red 78 : Builder_B1 : ok 79 : Architect_A4 : you're making a diamond 80 : Architect_A4 : put a red block in front of the final orange blocks 81 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2] 82 : Builder_B1 : here? 83 : Architect_A4 : yep 84 : Architect_A4 : same on other side 85 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2] 86 : Architect_A4 : now one below the red block 87 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2] 88 : Architect_A4 : and to the right 89 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2] 90 : Builder_B1 : is it a bridge? 91 : Architect_A4 : you're essentially making that V shape in red, but it's vertical 92 : Architect_A4 : delete those 93 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2] 94 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2] 95 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2] 96 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2] 97 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-2] 98 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2] 99 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2] 100 : Builder_B1 : here? 101 : Architect_A4 : no all the red blocks are in the same plane 102 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-2] 103 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1] 104 : Architect_A4 : yep one above that now 105 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1] 106 : Architect_A4 : one down and to the right 107 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0] 108 : Architect_A4 : now one up and to the right 109 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1] 110 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1] 111 : Builder_B1 : like this? 112 : Architect_A4 : good delete all but the middle base ones 113 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1] 114 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1] 115 : Architect_A4 : great 116 : Architect_A4 : make that same shape above to make a diamond 117 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:2] 118 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:2] 119 : Builder_B1 : above the red? 120 : Architect_A4 : yep; it's an upside down V in red still 121 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1] 122 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1] 123 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1] 124 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0] 125 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0] 126 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0] 127 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:2] 128 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1] 129 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:2] 130 : Architect_A4 : awesome 131 : Builder_B1 : cool 132 : Architect_A4 : all done
