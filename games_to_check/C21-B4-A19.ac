 0 : Builder_B4 : Mission has started . hi 1 : Architect_A19 : hi ok get some purple blocks ok so lets think of this like a coordinate system place a purple block in x = 3 , y = 4 2 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:2] 3 : Architect_A19 : now x = 4 , y=4 4 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:2] 5 : Architect_A19 : x = 5 , y = 4 6 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2] 7 : Architect_A19 : ok nvm can't use coordinates 8 : Builder_B4 : you could just say a line too 9 : Architect_A19 : place one to the right one spot of the block you just placed 10 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2] 11 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2] 12 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2] 13 : Architect_A19 : one space in between 14 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2] 15 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2] 16 : Architect_A19 : ok now two blocks directly to the right of the one you just placed in the same row 17 : Builder_B4 : as in two spaces with one blank space or two blank spaces ? 18 : Architect_A19 : no spaces 19 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:2] 20 : Architect_A19 : yeah now anotehr block to the right 21 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:2] 22 : Builder_B4 : oh another line of three 23 : Architect_A19 : ok yeah thats a better way to say it ok so on top place purple blocks alternating so one on each end of the line of 3 they are floating 24 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:2] 25 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:2] 26 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:2] 27 : Architect_A19 : yeah like taht 28 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:2] 29 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:2] 30 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:2] 31 : Architect_A19 : oh no what you were doing before was right 32 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:2] 33 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:2] 34 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:2] 35 : Architect_A19 : i meant theyre just not on the ground 36 : Builder_B4 : ok 37 : Architect_A19 : like the side on your left 38 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:2] 39 : Architect_A19 : ok now the next row should be completely filled , 7 blocks 40 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:2] 41 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2] 42 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2] 43 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2] 44 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2] 45 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:2] 46 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:2] 47 : Architect_A19 : ok now think of a window youre missing a block in z = 1 on the 3rd block of each side 48 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2] 49 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:2] 50 : Architect_A19 : yeah ok now get some red blocks so for the very top row extend the blocks on each end by adding 4 blocks in the air extend them in the perpendicular direction 51 : Builder_B4 : a floating line ? 52 : Architect_A19 : yeah 53 : Builder_B4 : behind the purple structure 54 : Architect_A19 : in the front wherever there is more space 55 : Builder_B4 : jutting out from the upper corner purple one 56 : Architect_A19 : yea 57 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:3 Z:1] 58 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:3 Z:0] 59 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1] 60 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-2] 61 : Architect_A19 : yeah like that 62 : Builder_B4 : both sides ? 63 : Architect_A19 : yep 64 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1] 65 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:0] 66 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-1] 67 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-2] 68 : Architect_A19 : ok now make a diagonal line from the last red blocks of each line to the ground 69 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-2] 70 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-3] 71 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-3] 72 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-4] 73 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-3] 74 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-2] 75 : Architect_A19 : yeah like that for the other side too 76 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-2] 77 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-3] 78 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-4] 79 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-2] 80 : Architect_A19 : ok done 81 : Builder_B4 : cool
