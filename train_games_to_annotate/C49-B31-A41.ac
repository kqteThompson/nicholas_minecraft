 0 : Builder_B31 : Mission has started . 1 : Architect_A41 : Okay . We are going to make a red capital A in the center of the map . It is three blocks wide , and four blocks high So first put two red blocks , separated by a space , in the center of the map 2 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1] 3 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1] 4 : Architect_A41 : Then three more red blocks on top of each of those 5 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1] 6 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1] 7 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1] 8 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1] 9 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1] 10 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1] 11 : Architect_A41 : Then connect the top blocks and the blocks one space above the bottom with red blocks 12 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1] 13 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1] 14 : Architect_A41 : Perfect Now make a column of four yellow blocks on the right side of the A , touching the side of it 15 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1] 16 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-1] 17 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1] 18 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-1] 19 : Architect_A41 : Okay , now on the side behind the A from where you are , make a " loop " of yellow blocks that is three blocks high , connected to the yellow column So the yellow will make a lowercase b 20 : Builder_B31 : A loop up or down ? 21 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1] 22 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:3 Z:-1] 23 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-1] 24 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-1] 25 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1] 26 : Builder_B31 : Like that ? 27 : Architect_A41 : Yes that's right , but needs to be rotated so it's perpendicular to the A and behind it 28 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1] 29 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:4 Y:3 Z:-1] 30 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-1] 31 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-1] 32 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1] 33 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2] 34 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3] 35 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-3] 36 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-3] 37 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-2] 38 : Architect_A41 : Perfect 39 : Builder_B31 : This way ? 40 : Architect_A41 : Okay now make a column of four blue blocks on the side of the b that is not touching the red A 41 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-4] 42 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-4] 43 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-4] 44 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-4] 45 : Builder_B31 : This side ? 46 : Architect_A41 : Yes perfect Now build out rows of two blocks on the top and bottom of that column , so they are parallel to the A 47 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-4] 48 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-4] 49 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-4] 50 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-4] 51 : Architect_A41 : Great . Now make a column of four purple blocks next to the red A , on the front face of the A , on the right . 52 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0] 53 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0] 54 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0] 55 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0] 56 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0] 57 : Architect_A41 : We're going to make a lowercase d that closes the cube . 58 : Builder_B31 : This side ? 59 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0] 60 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0] 61 : Architect_A41 : Other side 62 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0] 63 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2] 64 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-2] 65 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2] 66 : Architect_A41 : Yes perfect . Now a loop three blocks high on the bottom 67 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-3] 68 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-4] 69 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-4] 70 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-3] 71 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-4] 72 : Architect_A41 : Great ! We're done
