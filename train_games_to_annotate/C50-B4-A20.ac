 0 : Builder_B4 : Mission has started . 1 : Architect_A20 : leave room for a 7x7 structure we 'll start with the easiest purple this one floats in the air one block above the ground 2 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:4 Y:1 Z:4] 3 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:4 Y:2 Z:4] 4 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:4 Y:1 Z:4] 5 : Architect_A20 : actually move it one block inwards 6 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:4 Y:2 Z:4] 7 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:3] 8 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:3] 9 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:3] 10 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:3] 11 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:3] 12 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:6 Y:1 Z:4] 13 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:6 Y:1 Z:4] 14 : Architect_A20 : okay so from where you are currently looking put two purple to the right 15 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:2] 16 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:1] 17 : Architect_A20 : now fill upwards to make a 3x3 square 18 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:1] 19 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:2] 20 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:3] 21 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:4 Z:3] 22 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:4 Z:2] 23 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:4 Z:1] 24 : Architect_A20 : punch out blocks from that to make an " X " 25 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:1] 26 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:4 Z:2] 27 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:3] 28 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:2] 29 : Builder_B4 : like that ? 30 : Architect_A20 : yes 31 : Builder_B4 : good description 32 : Architect_A20 : thank you now switch to yello it also floats the top of yellow lines up with the top of purple 33 : Builder_B4 : how close to the purple structure ? 34 : Architect_A20 : it starts one block under purple ( to your left ) 35 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0] 36 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0] 37 : Builder_B4 : ? 38 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0] 39 : Architect_A20 : no sorry it's in the same line as the purple 40 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1] 41 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:2 Z:1] 42 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1] 43 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0] 44 : Architect_A20 : the long side of purple 45 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:0] 46 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0] 47 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:0] 48 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:2 Z:1] 49 : Architect_A20 : scoot it over one block so there's a space between 50 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0] 51 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1] 52 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1] 53 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1] 54 : Architect_A20 : perfect now build two up 55 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1] 56 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-1] 57 : Architect_A20 : knock down the bottom two 58 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1] 59 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1] 60 : Architect_A20 : make a line same as you did for purple like same direction 61 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-2] 62 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-3] 63 : Architect_A20 : knock out the middle 64 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-2] 65 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-2] 66 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-2] 67 : Architect_A20 : we're going to move to building on the opposite side you're on so other side of the purple and yellow still attached to the yellow so right at the edge in line with the two yellow you already made floating one block above the ground other edge sorry you 'll place two blocks similar to the ones floating in the air 68 : Builder_B4 : which yellow block ? i'll place one and you can tell me how to shift it 69 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-3] 70 : Architect_A20 : alrighty if you moved that two forward 71 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-3] 72 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-3] 73 : Architect_A20 : yep ! 74 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:5 Y:2 Z:-3] 75 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-3] 76 : Architect_A20 : it's yellow though 77 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-3] 78 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:5 Y:2 Z:-3] 79 : Architect_A20 : but yes ! 80 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:5 Y:2 Z:-3] 81 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-3] 82 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-3] 83 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:5 Y:2 Z:-3] 84 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:5 Y:2 Z:-3] 85 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:5 Y:2 Z:-3] 86 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:2 Z:-3] 87 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-3] 88 : Architect_A20 : the other yellow you 'll place will be lined up with the other high yellow 89 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:4 Z:-1] 90 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:4 Z:-1] 91 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:4 Y:4 Z:-1] 92 : Architect_A20 : same level as the one you just did 93 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:5 Y:4 Z:-1] 94 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-1] 95 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:2 Z:-1] 96 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-1] 97 : Architect_A20 : nice 98 : Builder_B4 : these shapes are f-ed up 99 : Architect_A20 : so place the last yellow so it connects the 4 you made 100 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:3 Z:-1] 101 : Architect_A20 : yeah , this one is really tricky 102 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:3 Z:-2] 103 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:3 Z:-2] 104 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:5 Y:3 Z:-1] 105 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:5 Y:2 Z:-3] 106 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-3] 107 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:2 Z:-3] 108 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:5 Y:3 Z:-2] 109 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-3] 110 : Architect_A20 : now for green so you know the space between purple and yellow ? 111 : Builder_B4 : yah 112 : Architect_A20 : two blocks over , place a green on the ground 113 : Builder_B4 : two blocks over from what ? 114 : Architect_A20 : from that space 115 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0] 116 : Architect_A20 : so it 'll be one block away from purple yup now in the direction of purple , make a 3x3 cube 117 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1] 118 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2] 119 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2] 120 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1] 121 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0] 122 : Builder_B4 : like that ?
