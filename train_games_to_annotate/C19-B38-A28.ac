23 : Architect_A28 : nah 24 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2] 25 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2] 26 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2] 27 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1] 28 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1] 29 : Builder_B38 : like this ? 30 : Architect_A28 : yeah like this 31 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 32 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1] 33 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1] 34 : Builder_B38 : how many steps ? 35 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0] 36 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0] 37 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0] 38 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0] 39 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0] 40 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 41 : Architect_A28 : do it three more times 42 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0] 43 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1] 44 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1] 45 : Builder_B38 : I ean out of blocks should I use a different collor ? 46 : Architect_A28 : nah can you take out all of them that aren't the actual stairs 47 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1] 48 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0] 49 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0] 50 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1] 51 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0] 52 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 53 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0] 54 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0] 55 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0] 56 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1] 57 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1] 58 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1] 59 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:1] 60 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1] 61 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1] 62 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:1] 63 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:1] 64 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:2] 65 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:2] 66 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:2] 67 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1] 68 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1] 69 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1] 70 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:2] 71 : Architect_A28 : nice 72 : Builder_B38 : is this good ? ok 73 : Architect_A28 : yeah alright and can you make one more staircase step with red this time 74 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:5 Z:3] 75 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:6 Z:3] 76 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:6 Z:3] 77 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:3] 78 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:4] 79 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:5 Z:3] 80 : Builder_B38 : are you sure we are going to have enough space ? 81 : Architect_A28 : yeah we 'll have enough space 82 : Builder_B38 : Ok 83 : Architect_A28 : and then can you put three red blocks across from the other red blocks touching them 84 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:4] 85 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:6 Z:4] 86 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:6 Z:4] 87 : Builder_B38 : like a platform ?
