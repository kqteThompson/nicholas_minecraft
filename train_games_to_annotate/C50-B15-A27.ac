36 : Architect_A27 : yeah 37 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-3] 38 : Architect_A27 : but put the purple block back in the middle 39 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-3] 40 : Architect_A27 : now place three purple on top of those 41 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-4] 42 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-3] 43 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2] 44 : Architect_A27 : do that three more times 45 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-4] 46 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-3] 47 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2] 48 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-2] 49 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-3] 50 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-4] 51 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-4] 52 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-3] 53 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-2] 54 : Architect_A27 : remove the top middle 55 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-3] 56 : Architect_A27 : on the left side remove the 2nd from the top 57 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-4] 58 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-4] 59 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-4] 60 : Architect_A27 : same for the right 61 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-2] 62 : Architect_A27 : remove the whole bottom row 63 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-3] 64 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2] 65 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-4] 66 : Architect_A27 : remove the middle of the bottom 67 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-3] 68 : Architect_A27 : actually the whole top of the structure needs to be shifted down a block so the two top corners need to be moved down a block 69 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-4] 70 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-4] 71 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-2] 72 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-2] 73 : Architect_A27 : now remove the top middle 74 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-3] 75 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-3] 76 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-3] 77 : Architect_A27 : and the two middle sides 78 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2] 79 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-4] 80 : Architect_A27 : one more piece to go on this one 81 : Builder_B15 : is it another x shape ? 82 : Architect_A27 : the next one is also off the ground it starts 3 spaces from the edge and a space away from the purple structure 83 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-4] 84 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-2] 85 : Builder_B15 : so in this area ? but off the ground ? 86 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-4] 87 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0] 88 : Architect_A27 : other side so keep going after the second block there that third one 89 : Builder_B15 : how mans spaces off the ground ? many * 90 : Architect_A27 : place 3 yellow blocks on the ground starting at the block 91 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0] 92 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0] 93 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0] 94 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0] 95 : Builder_B15 : starting there ? 96 : Architect_A27 : yes 97 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:1] 98 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:2] 99 : Builder_B15 : this direction , or towards the red ? 100 : Architect_A27 : thats right now a yellow block on the outer two 101 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:0] 102 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:2] 103 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:1] 104 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:2] 105 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0] 106 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-2] 107 : Builder_B15 : is this the base of the x ? 108 : Architect_A27 : yes but this one is slanted so the middle block is one space above those two 109 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:0] 110 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:1] 111 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:0] 112 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1] 113 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:1] 114 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-4 Y:3 Z:1] 115 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1] 116 : Builder_B15 : so there ? 117 : Architect_A27 : other side 118 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1] 119 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:1] 120 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1] 121 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-4 Y:3 Z:1] 122 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:1] 123 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1] 124 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:2] 125 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0] 126 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:1] 127 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1] 128 : Builder_B15 : like that ? 129 : Architect_A27 : thats it ! 130 : Builder_B15 : cool !
