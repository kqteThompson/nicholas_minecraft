 0 : Builder_B1 : Mission has started. 1 : Builder_B1 : hello 2 : Architect_A4 : hi 3 : Architect_A4 : you're building a bunch of diagonal staircases 4 : Architect_A4 : start with yellow 5 : Architect_A4 : and towards the edge but in the center 6 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:-4] 7 : Architect_A4 : more towards the middle of that edge 8 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-3] 9 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:-5] 10 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-3] 11 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:-5] 12 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:-4] 13 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-3] 14 : Builder_B1 : here? 15 : Architect_A4 : i mean where you should put your starting block 16 : Architect_A4 : the yellow staircase is in the middle 17 : Builder_B1 : in the middle of the building area? 18 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-3] 19 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0] 20 : Builder_B1 : oh wait 21 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-5] 22 : Builder_B1 : here? 23 : Architect_A4 : yeah great; the second one 24 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0] 25 : Architect_A4 : now a staircase: one towards teh center, but also raised vertically 26 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-4] 27 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-4] 28 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-4] 29 : Architect_A4 : good 30 : Builder_B1 : like this? 31 : Builder_B1 : ok 32 : Architect_A4 : one more like that so there's three steps 33 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-4] 34 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-3] 35 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-4] 36 : Builder_B1 : is this good? 37 : Architect_A4 : good 38 : Architect_A4 : switch to orange 39 : Architect_A4 : face along the length of hte yellow staircase 40 : Architect_A4 : the starting orange block is three to teh left 41 : Architect_A4 : five back 42 : Builder_B1 : to my left? 43 : Architect_A4 : yes 44 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-1] 45 : Builder_B1 : here? 46 : Architect_A4 : yes 47 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-1] 48 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1] 49 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-1] 50 : Architect_A4 : build one orange on top of it 51 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-1] 52 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1] 53 : Architect_A4 : delete the bottom one 54 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-1] 55 : Architect_A4 : now make a diagonal staircase 56 : Builder_B1 : towards the orange? 57 : Builder_B1 : i mean yellow? 58 : Architect_A4 : imagine a 2x2 cube where the two orange blocks make up opposite corners 59 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1] 60 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1] 61 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0] 62 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1] 63 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1] 64 : Architect_A4 : great 65 : Architect_A4 : now do the same to make it three long 66 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:0] 67 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:1] 68 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1] 69 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:0] 70 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:1] 71 : Architect_A4 : good switch to red 72 : Architect_A4 : orient yourself on the far side of the yellow staircase 73 : Architect_A4 : loooking in towards the center 74 : Builder_B1 : here? 75 : Architect_A4 : look along the length of the yellow 76 : Architect_A4 : like stand behind it 77 : Architect_A4 : yeah 78 : Architect_A4 : red starting block is 4 to the left and 3 up 79 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-2] 80 : Builder_B1 : is this good? 81 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-3] 82 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-2] 83 : Architect_A4 : fixed it 84 : Builder_B1 : here? 85 : Architect_A4 : yes 86 : Architect_A4 : now just do teh same thing you did with the orange blocks 87 : Architect_A4 : sloping towards the center 88 : Builder_B1 : okay 89 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-3] 90 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:3 Z:-3] 91 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:3 Z:-2] 92 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-2] 93 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:4 Y:3 Z:-2] 94 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:4 Y:3 Z:-3] 95 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-3] 96 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-2] 97 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-1] 98 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-1] 99 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-1] 100 : Architect_A4 : starting on the bottom level though 101 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-2] 102 : Builder_B1 : i see 103 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-3] 104 : Architect_A4 : don't delete your starting block 105 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-2] 106 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1] 107 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-1] 108 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-2] 109 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-3] 110 : Architect_A4 : good one more 111 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0] 112 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0] 113 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0] 114 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0] 115 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0] 116 : Architect_A4 : great
