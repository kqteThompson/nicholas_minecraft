 0 : Builder_B4 : Mission has started . 1 : Architect_A19 : ok get some blocks doesnt mamtter which cause this structure floats so as a base put a line of 7 blocks 2 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:3] 3 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:3] 4 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:3] 5 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:3] 6 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:3] 7 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:3] 8 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:3] 9 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:3] 10 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:1 Z:3] 11 : Architect_A19 : then get some orange blocks , these will be in the actual structure put three on one end two on the other end 12 : Builder_B4 : stacked vertically ? 13 : Architect_A19 : horizontally 14 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:3] 15 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:3] 16 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:3] 17 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:3] 18 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:3] 19 : Architect_A19 : then put a block every other square on top of this row , starting from each end so the next row should have 4 blocks in alternating spots 20 : Builder_B4 : are some of them floating ? 21 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:3] 22 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:3] 23 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:3] 24 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:3] 25 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:3 Z:3] 26 : Architect_A19 : uhyeah one of them floats 27 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:3] 28 : Builder_B4 : like that ? 29 : Architect_A19 : yep then the next row , fill the entire row with blocks so 7 blocks 30 : Builder_B4 : color ? 31 : Architect_A19 : oh yeah all should be orange , including the row you just made 32 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:4] 33 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:4] 34 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:3] 35 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:3] 36 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:3] 37 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:3] 38 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:3] 39 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:3 Y:3 Z:3] 40 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:3 Z:3] 41 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:3] 42 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:3] 43 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:3] 44 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:3] 45 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:3] 46 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:3] 47 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:3] 48 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:3] 49 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:3] 50 : Architect_A19 : yeah 51 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:3] 52 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:4 Z:3] 53 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:4 Z:3] 54 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:4 Z:4] 55 : Architect_A19 : then the very last row has a red block in the very center 56 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:3] 57 : Architect_A19 : then delete the base 58 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:3] 59 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:3] 60 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:3] 61 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:3] 62 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:3] 63 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:3] 64 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:1 Z:3] 65 : Architect_A19 : nvm sorry that wasnt the last thing the red top is a v shape so the next row on top of the red block should have two blocks with one horizontal space between them 66 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:5 Z:3] 67 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:6 Z:3] 68 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:3] 69 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:3] 70 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:3] 71 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:5 Z:3] 72 : Architect_A19 : yeah like that now another row except with three horizontal spaces 73 : Builder_B4 : got it 74 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:7 Z:3] 75 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:7 Z:3] 76 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:7 Z:3] 77 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:3] 78 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:7 Z:3] 79 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:3] 80 : Architect_A19 : ok now this is the last row , same thing except with 5 horizontal spaces 81 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:8 Z:3] 82 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:8 Z:3] 83 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:8 Z:3] 84 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:8 Z:3] 85 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:8 Z:3] 86 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:8 Z:3] 87 : Architect_A19 : ok now we're done 88 : Builder_B4 : great
