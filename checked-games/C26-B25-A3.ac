 0 : Builder_B25 : Mission has started . 1 : Architect_A3 : ok this one uses all the colors and is a weird shape one second 2 : Builder_B25 : ok 3 : Architect_A3 : it should only take a 4x4 space on the ground with some piece removed but it extends up into the air 4 : Builder_B25 : ok , do you want to do it level by level ? actually your call , you're the architect 5 : Architect_A3 : sorry had a technical question . yeah we 'll go 1 level at a time that sounds good place 2 blue blocks diagonal from each other , that will be the bottom left of our figure 6 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:1] 7 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0] 8 : Architect_A3 : can you move the top one to the left side should have specified 9 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0] 10 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0] 11 : Architect_A3 : yeah there 12 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 13 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0] 14 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:1] 15 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0] 16 : Builder_B25 : just going to center it a bit my bad 17 : Architect_A3 : no problem . then if you could place 1 yellow block 1 space away from the right blue block and make 3 diagonal pieces going the same direction that should be the first floor 18 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1] 19 : Builder_B25 : like that ? 20 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1] 21 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:0] 22 : Architect_A3 : whoops i forgot to clarify again . it should be to the right of the blue block yeah there 23 : Builder_B25 : ok and then what are the 3 diagonal pieces ? 24 : Architect_A3 : then 3 more yellows going diagonally to the left like the blue 25 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1] 26 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2] 27 : Architect_A3 : it kind of looks like a multi-floor rainbow for reference 28 : Builder_B25 : like that ? 29 : Architect_A3 : close , just up to the left 30 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2] 31 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1] 32 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1] 33 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2] 34 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2] 35 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2] 36 : Builder_B25 : my bad 37 : Architect_A3 : yeah like that just 1 more yellow 38 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3] 39 : Architect_A3 : ok nice the second floor is green and red . lets start with green it also goes in a diagonal and sort of fills the spaces between the blue and yellow , but above 40 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0] 41 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0] 42 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0] 43 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0] 44 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1] 45 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0] 46 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1] 47 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2] 48 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1] 49 : Architect_A3 : yeah perfect 50 : Builder_B25 : where does the red go ? 51 : Architect_A3 : its the same as green ( 3 pieces ) but up and to the right a bit 52 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1] 53 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1] 54 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1] 55 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-2] 56 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-2] 57 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-2] 58 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-3] 59 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-3] 60 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-3] 61 : Architect_A3 : yeah like that 62 : Builder_B25 : yay 63 : Architect_A3 : third floor is purple with only 2 diagonal blocks 64 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-3] 65 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-2] 66 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-3] 67 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1] 68 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1] 69 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1] 70 : Architect_A3 : its on the other side of the red so it sort of forms a corner 71 : Builder_B25 : im going to assume for aesthetic purposes they go there oh ok 72 : Architect_A3 : i wish 73 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1] 74 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-2] 75 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-3] 76 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-3] 77 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-3] 78 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-3] 79 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-2] 80 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-3] 81 : Architect_A3 : last piece orange fills the corner on the 4th floor 82 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-3] 83 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-3] 84 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-3] 85 : Architect_A3 : there we go good job builder :-) 86 : Builder_B25 : what's a builder without an architect ???
