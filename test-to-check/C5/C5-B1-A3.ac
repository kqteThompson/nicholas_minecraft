 0 : Builder_B1 : Mission has started. 1 : Builder_B1 : hello. Whats our mission this time? 2 : Architect_A3 : we have a difficult one ahead of us this time builder. bear with me 3 : Builder_B1 : describe the structure? 4 : Architect_A3 : we will start using red blocks. if you recall from our previous mission we built an open 3x3 square as the second level of our "table 5 : Architect_A3 : this shape is now extending upwards instead of laying flat 6 : Builder_B1 : okay 7 : Architect_A3 : sort of like a window 8 : Builder_B1 : can i build anywhere? 9 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1] 10 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1] 11 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1] 12 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1] 13 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1] 14 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1] 15 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1] 16 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1] 17 : Architect_A3 : yes i think that will work 18 : Architect_A3 : now please place a red block on the left and right sides of the window, in the middle of each side 19 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1] 20 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1] 21 : Builder_B1 : these ones? 22 : Architect_A3 : yes place them adjacent to those you just removed 23 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1] 24 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1] 25 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1] 26 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1] 27 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:1] 28 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:2 Z:1] 29 : Architect_A3 : perfect 30 : Architect_A3 : the second half of this structure is the same using purple blocks, but oriented differently. i will attempt to start you off step by step though 31 : Builder_B1 : so parallel? 32 : Builder_B1 : or perpendicular? 33 : Architect_A3 : it is attached to our current structure sort of parallel and rotated 90 degrees. anyway please place the first purple block on the rightmost red block 34 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:2] 35 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:1] 36 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0] 37 : Builder_B1 : is it connected? 38 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0] 39 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0] 40 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:1] 41 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:2] 42 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2] 43 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:3] 44 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1] 45 : Architect_A3 : not quite 46 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1] 47 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:3] 48 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:1] 49 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0] 50 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2] 51 : Architect_A3 : its as if they were laying side by side and the purple one gets tilted up 90 degrees so it faces the sky 52 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:2] 53 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:2] 54 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:1] 55 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0] 56 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0] 57 : Builder_B1 : oh so its on the ground? 58 : Architect_A3 : we can start off with the first few blocks and you will see soon 59 : Architect_A3 : the first purple block needs to be attached to the rightmost block, so that it hangs in the air and is closer to you 60 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:1] 61 : Builder_B1 : here? 62 : Architect_A3 : if you move that block to the other side of that red block so that it is on your side and not just an extension 63 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:1] 64 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0] 65 : Architect_A3 : yes 66 : Builder_B1 : is this the arm of the window? 67 : Architect_A3 : nowplease make the open square (window) on top of that new purple block 68 : Architect_A3 : yes it is 69 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0] 70 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:0] 71 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0] 72 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:0] 73 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:0] 74 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:0] 75 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0] 76 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0] 77 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:0] 78 : Builder_B1 : is this good? 79 : Architect_A3 : ok builder i have bad news but it's an easy fix 80 : Architect_A3 : i gave you the wrong side 81 : Builder_B1 : on the back or other side? 82 : Architect_A3 : if you could do that exact structure so that its on the left side of the red square from where you were standing it will be correct 83 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0] 84 : Builder_B1 : here? 85 : Architect_A3 : yes 86 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0] 87 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0] 88 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0] 89 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0] 90 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:0] 91 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:0] 92 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:0] 93 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:0] 94 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0] 95 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0] 96 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0] 97 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:0] 98 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0] 99 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:0] 100 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:4 Z:0] 101 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0] 102 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:5 Z:0] 103 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:5 Z:0] 104 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:6 Z:0] 105 : Builder_B1 : is this it? 106 : Architect_A3 : good job builder, i am sorry for the incorrect instructions 107 : Architect_A3 : that is correct 108 : Builder_B1 : you did a good job! 109 : Architect_A3 : thank you for being my builder
