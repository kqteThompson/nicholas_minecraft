33 : Architect_A23 : no that is perfect , but i make the green too short . the green need five , not three . 34 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0] 35 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0] 36 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0] 37 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0] 38 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0] 39 : Builder_B31 : like that ? 40 : Architect_A23 : yes , and the purpe x on top , still with the longer diagonals . 41 : Builder_B31 : move the purple up two blocks as well ? 42 : Architect_A23 : yes . sorry . looking at it at the wrong angle 43 : Builder_B31 : is the purple sitting on top of the top green block or is it in front , on a different plane ?
