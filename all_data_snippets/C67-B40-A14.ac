 0 : Builder_B40 : Mission has started. 1 : Architect_A14 : Place two yellow blocks on the grid. This structure mostly goes upward so you don't need a lot of room. But don't go too close to the edges 2 : Builder_B40 : sounds good 3 : Builder_B40 : so a stack of yellow blocks? 4 : Architect_A14 : Sorry two next to each other 5 : Builder_B40 : cool 6 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1] 7 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1] 8 : Architect_A14 : Great. Now stack another yellow one on top of the right one, and place another yellow one to the right of the stacked block 9 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1] 10 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:1] 11 : Architect_A14 : Great! Now you're going to stack three yellow blocks in a row, top on top of these and then one jutting out 12 : Builder_B40 : on top of which block? 13 : Architect_A14 : Oh sorry the two blocks you just stacked 14 : Builder_B40 : ah i see what you mean 15 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1] 16 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:1] 17 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0] 18 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0] 19 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1] 20 : Builder_B40 : i thought by stack you meant vertically stack 21 : Builder_B40 : is this what you had in mind? 22 : Architect_A14 : Sorry! I meant stack one on top of each 23 : Architect_A14 : Yes this is perfect 24 : Builder_B40 : ah! 25 : Builder_B40 : gotcha 26 : Architect_A14 : Now stack a yellow block each on top of the center block and the right block 27 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1] 28 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:1] 29 : Builder_B40 : just curious... what are we building? 30 : Architect_A14 : You stacked on the left and right. Can you move the left block to the center? 31 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1] 32 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:1] 33 : Architect_A14 : I have no idea! 34 : Builder_B40 : ah my bad 35 : Builder_B40 : lol 36 : Builder_B40 : okay 37 : Architect_A14 : Great! Now we're going to place four purple blocks on a row on top of this. Two are stacked on the two blocks on top here 38 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:1] 39 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:1] 40 : Architect_A14 : The other two jut out on either side 41 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:1] 42 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-4 Y:5 Z:1] 43 : Architect_A14 : Great! Now stack four purple blocks in a row on top of this row 44 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-4 Y:6 Z:1] 45 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:1] 46 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:1] 47 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:1] 48 : Architect_A14 : Now add a block to either side so it juts out. a row of six purple blocks total 49 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-5 Y:6 Z:1] 50 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:0] 51 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:1] 52 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:0] 53 : Architect_A14 : Nice! Now place four more purple blocks in a row on top of the four center blocks 54 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:1] 55 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:7 Z:1] 56 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:7 Z:1] 57 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-4 Y:7 Z:1] 58 : Architect_A14 : Great! Last step. Stack a purple block on each of the middle two blocks 59 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:8 Z:1] 60 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:8 Z:1] 61 : Architect_A14 : We're done! 62 : Builder_B40 : gg
