 0 : Builder_B31 : Mission has started . 1 : Architect_A41 : Okay , make two rows of two purple blocks , parallel and separated by a space 2 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1] 3 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1] 4 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1] 5 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 6 : Architect_A41 : Okay , and add another purple in line with each of those , but separated by a space 7 : Builder_B31 : Does it matter which side ? 8 : Architect_A41 : Doesn't matter 9 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:1] 10 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1] 11 : Builder_B31 : Like this ? 12 : Architect_A41 : Yep perfect . Now make a 3x3 platform out of red blocks , so that the corners of the platform are on the two isolated purple blocks and the platform spans the space between the 1 and 2 block assemblies 13 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1] 14 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-1] 15 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:0] 16 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:1] 17 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1] 18 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0] 19 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0] 20 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:1] 21 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1] 22 : Architect_A41 : Close , but the row that is hanging off the edge away from the purple blocks should be on the other side 23 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:1] 24 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:0] 25 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-1] 26 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1] 27 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0] 28 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1] 29 : Builder_B31 : Like that ? 30 : Architect_A41 : Yes perfect Okay , now attach a blue block on the side of the top middle red block , on the side above the purple blocks with nothing on top of them 31 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1] 32 : Builder_B31 : Here ? 33 : Architect_A41 : Oh whoops , there should be another layer of red before we do this 34 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1] 35 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1] 36 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1] 37 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1] 38 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0] 39 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0] 40 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 41 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:1] 42 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1] 43 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1] 44 : Builder_B31 : Is that right ? 45 : Architect_A41 : Yes Okay , now on the side of the top red layer on the side toward the exposed purple blocks , put a blue block so it is floating but attached on the side 46 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0] 47 : Architect_A41 : Perfect , now another blue on top of that one 48 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0] 49 : Architect_A41 : Great , now other blue to the side of that one , away from the red 50 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0] 51 : Architect_A41 : Now another blue on the side of that one , on the side facing you 52 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:4 Z:1] 53 : Builder_B31 : Here ? 54 : Architect_A41 : Yep Now we need to make a floating block which is one space higher than that blue , next to it on the side away from the red 55 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:5 Z:1] 56 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:5 Z:1] 57 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:5 Z:1] 58 : Builder_B31 : Like that ? 59 : Architect_A41 : Perfect Okay now on the other side of the red blocks from the blue structure , make a row of three orange blocks , one space separated from the purple blocks on the ground 60 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-1] 61 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:0] 62 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1] 63 : Architect_A41 : Ah , it should be on the ground 64 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1] 65 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:0] 66 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-1] 67 : Architect_A41 : And one space over 68 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-1] 69 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0] 70 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:1] 71 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:2] 72 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:2] 73 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:-1] 74 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:0] 75 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:1] 76 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:1] 77 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0] 78 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-1] 79 : Architect_A41 : Okay great . Now build three more rows of orange on top 80 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:-1] 81 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:0] 82 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:1] 83 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:3 Z:-1] 84 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:3 Z:0] 85 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:3 Z:1] 86 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:4 Z:-1] 87 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:4 Z:0] 88 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:4 Z:1] 89 : Architect_A41 : And remove the top middle orange block 90 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-4 Y:4 Z:0] 91 : Architect_A41 : And the bottom row of orange blocks 92 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:1] 93 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:0] 94 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:-1] 95 : Architect_A41 : Great ! We did it
