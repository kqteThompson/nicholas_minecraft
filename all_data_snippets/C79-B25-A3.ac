 0 : Builder_B25 : Mission has started. 1 : Architect_A3 : ok this next one is a bunch of crosses of varying shapes. the whole figure is off the ground so we need placeholders 2 : Architect_A3 : 1 sec while i figure it out 3 : Builder_B25 : for sure 4 : Architect_A3 : ok there are 2 flat crosses and 2 upright crosses. lets start with the upright ones. and lets use purple blocks as placeholders 5 : Builder_B25 : ok 6 : Architect_A3 : in the back leftish corner of the space place 1 purple block 3 spaces in from the side 7 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-3] 8 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-3] 9 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-4] 10 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-4] 11 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-4] 12 : Builder_B25 : is that good enough? 13 : Architect_A3 : yes 14 : Architect_A3 : now place 3 blue blocks in a straight line above that purple block 15 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3] 16 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2] 17 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1] 18 : Architect_A3 : whoops, i mean above the purple one, extending into the air 19 : Builder_B25 : ohhh ok 20 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2] 21 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1] 22 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3] 23 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-4] 24 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-4] 25 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-4] 26 : Builder_B25 : no prob 27 : Architect_A3 : ok nice 28 : Architect_A3 : now place 1 blue block on either side of the middle blue block to make a cross like a plus sign 29 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-4] 30 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-4] 31 : Builder_B25 : amen brother 32 : Architect_A3 : great you can remove that purple block now 33 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-4] 34 : Architect_A3 : ok the next cross is orange and flat. place 4 orange blocks extending to the right of the rightmost blue block 35 : Builder_B25 : like flat on the ground? 36 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-4] 37 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-4] 38 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-4] 39 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-4] 40 : Architect_A3 : nah it should be in the air 41 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-4] 42 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-4] 43 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-4] 44 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-4] 45 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-4] 46 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-4] 47 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-4] 48 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-4] 49 : Architect_A3 : yeah like that 50 : Builder_B25 : kk 51 : Architect_A3 : then place 1 orange block on the middle right orange block, on your side so that it comes toward you 52 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-5] 53 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-3] 54 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-4] 55 : Builder_B25 : we good? 56 : Architect_A3 : nice just like that. 2 more crosses 57 : Architect_A3 : oh put that orange one back, this one is supposed to be longer 58 : Architect_A3 : the whole figure is connected 59 : Builder_B25 : im getting positive vibes from this build 60 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:3 Z:-4] 61 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-4] 62 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-4 Y:3 Z:-4] 63 : Builder_B25 : like that? 64 : Architect_A3 : ok next is yellow and it looks like the blue cross only with 1 more piece on each side and its flat. put the first block on the rightmost orange block from your view right now 65 : Architect_A3 : yup all good so far 66 : Builder_B25 : which face on the rightmost orange block does it go on? 67 : Builder_B25 : facing up, facing me, facing down 68 : Architect_A3 : facing you, it should be flat like the orange 69 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-3] 70 : Architect_A3 : yup there 71 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2] 72 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1] 73 : Architect_A3 : should be 2 more in that line and we can make the cross section 74 : Builder_B25 : can you explain what you meant by one more piece on each side? 75 : Builder_B25 : did you mean the middle piece? 76 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 77 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1] 78 : Architect_A3 : right like that. then put 2 more on either side of the middle piece 79 : Builder_B25 : kk 80 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1] 81 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1] 82 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1] 83 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1] 84 : Architect_A3 : there thats good. now we have 1 more and its green 85 : Architect_A3 : its upright like the blue and the middle piece is attached to the leftmost yellowpiece 86 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1] 87 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1] 88 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-1] 89 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-1] 90 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:-1] 91 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:0] 92 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-2] 93 : Builder_B25 : like that? 94 : Architect_A3 : not there, like 1 rotations to the right 95 : Architect_A3 : my bad, i try to describe it from where you were standing earlier 96 : Builder_B25 : oh ok lemme go back 97 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:-1] 98 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-1] 99 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:0] 100 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-1] 101 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-2] 102 : Builder_B25 : how would you describe it from here? 103 : Architect_A3 : its should be directly across from the orange piece, that side. you had the shape and orientation right though. so on the right side from where you are 104 : Builder_B25 : on this block? 105 : Architect_A3 : yeah looks like it 106 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2] 107 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2] 108 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2] 109 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:3] 110 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1] 111 : Builder_B25 : like that? 112 : Architect_A3 : should be upright like the blue cross and attached at the middle of the new cross 113 : Builder_B25 : middle of the yellow cross? 114 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1] 115 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:3] 116 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2] 117 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2] 118 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:2] 119 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2] 120 : Architect_A3 : yeah like that 121 : Builder_B25 : or like that 122 : Builder_B25 : kk 123 : Architect_A3 : nice all done
