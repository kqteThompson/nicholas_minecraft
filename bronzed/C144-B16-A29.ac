30 : Architect_A29 : on the ground 31 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0] 32 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0] 33 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0] 34 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0] 35 : Architect_A29 : shift it over one more 36 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0] 37 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0] 38 : Architect_A29 : righto 39 : Architect_A29 : still along the line 40 : Architect_A29 : 2 red up along the diagonal 41 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0] 42 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0] 43 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0] 44 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:0] 45 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:0] 46 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:0] 47 : Architect_A29 : excellent 48 : Architect_A29 : now we're going to build along the perpendicular line 49 : Architect_A29 : in the direction you're facint 50 : Architect_A29 : facing 51 : Architect_A29 : one more up along the diagonal 52 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-4 Y:3 Z:0] 53 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-4 Y:4 Z:0] 54 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-4 Y:3 Z:0] 55 : Builder_B16 : this? 56 : Architect_A29 : not quite 57 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-4 Y:4 Z:0] 58 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-1] 59 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:-1] 60 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-1] 61 : Architect_A29 : yes but flip it over the axis 62 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:-1] 63 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1] 64 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:1] 65 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:2] 66 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:1] 67 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1] 68 : Architect_A29 : precisely 69 : Builder_B16 : great 70 : Architect_A29 : now one red block down along the diagonal 71 : Architect_A29 : from the last one 72 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:2] 73 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:2] 74 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:2] 75 : Architect_A29 : great now one orange below that one 76 : Builder_B16 : diagonally or nah? 77 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:2] 78 : Architect_A29 : no, just right below it 79 : Architect_A29 : ok 80 : Architect_A29 : two more orange blocks to go 81 : Architect_A29 : these are on the ground 82 : Architect_A29 : on the diagonal back toward the line we started on 83 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:1] 84 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0] 85 : Architect_A29 : almost 86 : Architect_A29 : but the other way 87 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:1] 88 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0] 89 : Architect_A29 : and shifted one block away from the structure 90 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-1] 91 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0] 92 : Builder_B16 : here? 93 : Architect_A29 : not quite 94 : Builder_B16 : grr, okay 95 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0] 96 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-1] 97 : Architect_A29 : one is on the original line, the last block on the ground 98 : Architect_A29 : on the line the Pis on 99 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0] 100 : Builder_B16 : a block here? 101 : Architect_A29 : yes, but the very last space on the ground before going out of bounds 102 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0] 103 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:0] 104 : Architect_A29 : perfect 105 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-5 Y:2 Z:0] 106 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:0] 107 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-5 Y:2 Z:0] 108 : Architect_A29 : remove that last one 109 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:0] 110 : Architect_A29 : ok one more on the ground 111 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:0] 112 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:0] 113 : Architect_A29 : on the diagonal toward the other orange block 114 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:1]
