 0 : Builder_B47 : Mission has started . 1 : Architect_A30 : ok this one is a bunch of interlocking T shapes start in the center of the board and build a standing T that is 3 blocks tall and 3 blocks wide in yellow 2 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0] 3 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0] 4 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0] 5 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0] 6 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0] 7 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0] 8 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 9 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0] 10 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0] 11 : Architect_A30 : ok good now on the left end of the top of the T , build a tower of 3 red blocks , starting from the side of the T and going up 12 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0] 13 : Builder_B47 : here ? 14 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0] 15 : Architect_A30 : yes 16 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:5 Z:0] 17 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0] 18 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:5 Z:0] 19 : Architect_A30 : delete those end pieces 20 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:5 Z:0] 21 : Builder_B47 : of he red t? 22 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0] 23 : Architect_A30 : yes those will serve as the top of the T now from where you are standing , build a row of 4 red squares to finsih the red T , but have it go towards the end of the board you are looking towards 24 : Builder_B47 : 4 squares ? 25 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:6 Z:0] 26 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:6 Z:-1] 27 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:6 Z:0] 28 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:6 Z:-1] 29 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-1] 30 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:5 Z:1] 31 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:5 Z:2] 32 : Architect_A30 : no sorry . wrong way 33 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:5 Z:2] 34 : Architect_A30 : have the middle of that row of 3 that you built be the center 35 : Builder_B47 : parallel , or perpendicular to the yellow ? 36 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-1] 37 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:5 Z:1] 38 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0] 39 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0] 40 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1] 41 : Architect_A30 : perpendicular 42 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1] 43 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-2] 44 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0] 45 : Builder_B47 : this ? 46 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-2] 47 : Architect_A30 : yes but connect it to the middle of the red tower you built 48 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0] 49 : Architect_A30 : no . delete all of the red besides that tower of 3 50 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0] 51 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0] 52 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1] 53 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1] 54 : Architect_A30 : sorry this is confusing to explain 55 : Builder_B47 : do it block by block 56 : Architect_A30 : ok so the middle of the red row will serve as the middle of the top of the T so on the opposite side of where you are , build a row of 4 out 57 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:5 Z:1] 58 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:5 Z:2] 59 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:5 Z:3] 60 : Builder_B47 : here ? 61 : Architect_A30 : one row down but yes 62 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:5 Z:1] 63 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:5 Z:2] 64 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:5 Z:3] 65 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:1] 66 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:2] 67 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:3] 68 : Architect_A30 : yes ! ok now to the next one now from the opposite side of the yellow T from the red , build one blue square on top of the end yellow 69 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0] 70 : Architect_A30 : yes now in the same direction the red is going , build a row of 3 blue 71 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1] 72 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:2] 73 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:3] 74 : Architect_A30 : delete the end . the one you already built was included . sorry 75 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:3] 76 : Architect_A30 : now from the middle of that blue row , build it to the ground 77 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1] 78 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1] 79 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1] 80 : Architect_A30 : ok now place on green square on the right inside corner of the blue T 81 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2] 82 : Architect_A30 : yes now build it so its a row of 5 connecting towards the red 83 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2] 84 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2] 85 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:2] 86 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:3 Z:2] 87 : Architect_A30 : now build it so its an upside down T 88 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:3 Z:3] 89 : Builder_B47 : from this end ? and 3 wide , like the rest ? 90 : Architect_A30 : no start from the middle of the green row and build upwards 91 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:3 Y:3 Z:3] 92 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:2] 93 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:5 Z:2] 94 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:6 Z:2] 95 : Architect_A30 : thats it !
