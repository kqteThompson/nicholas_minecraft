 0 : Builder_B21 : Mission has started . 1 : Architect_A15 : ready ? 2 : Builder_B21 : yup 3 : Architect_A15 : cool ! this one looks a little more complex so you're going to want to start by making a row of 4 blue blocks 4 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2] 5 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2] 6 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2] 7 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2] 8 : Architect_A15 : now , on each of the two end blocks , put another blue block 9 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-2] 10 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2] 11 : Architect_A15 : then make another row of blue blocks on top of those , so it's a hollow rectangle 12 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-2] 13 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-2] 14 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2] 15 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2] 16 : Architect_A15 : okay , now on the side you're standing on now , place a purple block in front of both of the top corners of the structure 17 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-3] 18 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-3] 19 : Builder_B21 : like that ? 20 : Architect_A15 : yep ! :) then diagonally in front of those blocks , put two more purple blocks , so they make an arc shape 21 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-4] 22 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-4] 23 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-4] 24 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-4] 25 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-4] 26 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-4] 27 : Architect_A15 : perfect ! alright , now move over to the other side of the structure you 'll want a yellow block in front of the topright blue block 28 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1] 29 : Architect_A15 : yep ! and on the opposite side , put a green block 30 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1] 31 : Architect_A15 : yep ! now , put another green block one cell above and in front of the current one 32 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1] 33 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0] 34 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1] 35 : Builder_B21 : like that ? 36 : Architect_A15 : good ! this is hard to describe you 'll want another yellow block above , in front of , and to the right of the current one from the perspective of where you currenrtly are 37 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-1] 38 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0] 39 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0] 40 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0] 41 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-1] 42 : Architect_A15 : perfect ! now place one more yellow block in that exact same trajectory so that its corners touch the highest yellow and green blocks 43 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0] 44 : Architect_A15 : whoops , sorry , that was unclear 45 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0] 46 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0] 47 : Architect_A15 : the 1st , 2nd , and 3rd yellow blocks should all be in a diagonal line :) 48 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0] 49 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0] 50 : Architect_A15 : perfect ! :) 51 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1] 52 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0] 53 : Architect_A15 : oh wait yeah now it's good , sorry D: 54 : Builder_B21 : cool !
