 0 : Builder_B49 : Mission has started . 1 : Architect_A39 : okay sorry , hi , first of all let's start near the center of the board 2 : Builder_B49 : on the ground ? 3 : Architect_A39 : there's only going to be one block on the ground everything else extends up from that make it a red block 4 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0] 5 : Architect_A39 : this is going to be the base of a T shape three high , three wide 6 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0] 7 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 8 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0] 9 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0] 10 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0] 11 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0] 12 : Architect_A39 : let's start with the left side of this T since it's simpler build another red block diagonally up and left from the left end of the T. it should lie on the same plane 13 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0] 14 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0] 15 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0] 16 : Architect_A39 : do this one more time but with a green block 17 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0] 18 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0] 19 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0] 20 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0] 21 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0] 22 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0] 23 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0] 24 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0] 25 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:4 Z:0] 26 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:5 Z:0] 27 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:3 Y:4 Z:0] 28 : Architect_A39 : that looked rough but you got it okay , now for the right side on top of the right end of the T , place two more red blocks 29 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0] 30 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0] 31 : Architect_A39 : directly to the right of those two you just placed , place green blocks 32 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:0] 33 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:0] 34 : Architect_A39 : place another red block on top of that top green block 35 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:0] 36 : Architect_A39 : diagonally up and right of that top red block , place a green block 37 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:7 Z:0] 38 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:7 Z:0] 39 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:7 Z:0] 40 : Builder_B49 : ok 41 : Architect_A39 : extending out from the bottom green block on the right , place two green blocks 42 : Builder_B49 : this one ? 43 : Architect_A39 : i think so , it's a little hard for me to tell what you're exactly looking at 44 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1] 45 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-2] 46 : Architect_A39 : no no , to the right of it still on the same plane as everything else 47 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-2] 48 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-2] 49 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-2] 50 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1] 51 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:0] 52 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-4 Y:4 Z:0] 53 : Architect_A39 : yup ! okay , we are done with this plane . there are a few more blocks on the planes directly in front of and behind all this stuff 54 : Builder_B49 : ready 55 : Architect_A39 : directly in front of the bottom left two green blocks , put green blocks 56 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1] 57 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-1] 58 : Builder_B49 : ok 59 : Architect_A39 : oops the second one isn't right 60 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-2] 61 : Architect_A39 : put it along that bottom row 62 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-2] 63 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1] 64 : Architect_A39 : my bad wait you removed the one that was correct 65 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1] 66 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-1] 67 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-2] 68 : Builder_B49 : like this ? 69 : Architect_A39 : not quite 70 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-2] 71 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-2] 72 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-2] 73 : Architect_A39 : it's to the right of that newest green block 74 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1] 75 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1] 76 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:-1] 77 : Architect_A39 : yeah ! okay now go over to the other side of this thing you see how there's a row of three green blocks here on the left ? 78 : Builder_B49 : yeah 79 : Architect_A39 : we're going to put one last green block on the middle of that row , towards you 80 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:1] 81 : Builder_B49 : got it 82 : Architect_A39 : perfect let me check that everything is right cool looks good !
