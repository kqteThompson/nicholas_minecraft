 0 : Builder_B16 : Mission has started . 1 : Architect_A1 : his one looks like a tree house 2 : Builder_B16 : cute ! 3 : Architect_A1 : the tree is red start with three blocks forming a tower 4 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0] 5 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0] 6 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0] 7 : Architect_A1 : can you add it a little more to the center 8 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0] 9 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0] 10 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0] 11 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0] 12 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0] 13 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0] 14 : Architect_A1 : great now add two more on the opposite sides of the tree 15 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0] 16 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 17 : Architect_A1 : yes thats good okay now stand on the tree on the left branch looking away from the tree add a step of one red block 18 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:3 Z:0] 19 : Architect_A1 : like a stair case going up 20 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:4 Z:0] 21 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:3 Z:0] 22 : Architect_A1 : yes like that 23 : Builder_B16 : okay cool 24 : Architect_A1 : now add one more step this time green 25 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:4 Y:4 Z:0] 26 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:4 Y:5 Z:0] 27 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:4 Y:4 Z:0] 28 : Architect_A1 : good now on the other side the branch goes up two more red blocks 29 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0] 30 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0] 31 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0] 32 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0] 33 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-1] 34 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-1] 35 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:0] 36 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0] 37 : Architect_A1 : sorry these are not steps 38 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0] 39 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:0] 40 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0] 41 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0] 42 : Architect_A1 : its tower of three 43 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0] 44 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0] 45 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0] 46 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0] 47 : Architect_A1 : yes like that now like the other side add one red step followed by a green step 48 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:6 Z:0] 49 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:0] 50 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:6 Z:0] 51 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:0] 52 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:7 Z:0] 53 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:0] 54 : Architect_A1 : okay time to add more leaves on the bottom on the last red step you placed add two green blocks 55 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0] 56 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:0] 57 : Builder_B16 : this ? 58 : Architect_A1 : almost it should be touching the red branch 59 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:0] 60 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0] 61 : Architect_A1 : great now add three more green all parallel to the ground making a box or square and using the last green block you placed as one of the corners 62 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1] 63 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-2] 64 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-3] 65 : Builder_B16 : this ? 66 : Architect_A1 : almost it should be a square so 2x2 67 : Builder_B16 : ahh okay 68 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-3] 69 : Architect_A1 : instead of 4x1 70 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-1] 71 : Architect_A1 : almost remember its parallel to the ground not perpendicular 72 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-1] 73 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:0] 74 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1] 75 : Architect_A1 : got it now we only need two more green blocks both green block are touching one of the blocks from the square you just placed one of the green block is on the back of the tree and the other is on the right side 76 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:1] 77 : Builder_B16 : here ? 78 : Architect_A1 : yes there 79 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:0] 80 : Builder_B16 : and this one ? 81 : Architect_A1 : yes thats it i think 82 : Builder_B16 : weird , okay !
