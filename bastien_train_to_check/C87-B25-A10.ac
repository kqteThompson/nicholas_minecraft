 0 : Builder_B25 : Mission has started . 1 : Architect_A10 : so this one doesn't really have an overall shape but there are four floating blocks . I will get to those later . start at the left edge with two orange blocks 2 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-1] 3 : Builder_B25 : vertical or horizontal ? 4 : Architect_A10 : horizontally placed toward the middle 5 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-1] 6 : Architect_A10 : cool . now , make a stair case of height three with orange . like put two more down , on top of the current , but shifted one to the right headed the same direction as the first 7 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-1] 8 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1] 9 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0] 10 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1] 11 : Builder_B25 : like that ? 12 : Architect_A10 : what you had initially before you added the third block was the right structure 13 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0] 14 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1] 15 : Architect_A10 : yes 16 : Builder_B25 : oh like the tetris piece 17 : Architect_A10 : yes ! now there is another " stair step " on top of that 18 : Builder_B25 : should I just build the same thing I just did ? 19 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1] 20 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1] 21 : Architect_A10 : yep ! that completes the first structure . 22 : Builder_B25 : ok 23 : Architect_A10 : now on to the four floating blocks . they are all separate . place a block down two spaces right of the edge of the first structure 24 : Builder_B25 : what color 25 : Architect_A10 : oh , all orange from here on out 26 : Builder_B25 : ok 27 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1] 28 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1] 29 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1] 30 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1] 31 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1] 32 : Builder_B25 : like that or on the ground ? 33 : Architect_A10 : on the ground , and one less far away 34 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 35 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1] 36 : Architect_A10 : in the vertical direction above the block you just placed , there are two floating orange blocks . one is right on top of what you just placed . the other is 4 above that . 37 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1] 38 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1] 39 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1] 40 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1] 41 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1] 42 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1] 43 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-1] 44 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1] 45 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1] 46 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1] 47 : Builder_B25 : like that ? i can use green to make it easier to check 48 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2] 49 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2] 50 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1] 51 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1] 52 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1] 53 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1] 54 : Architect_A10 : not quite . shift all that down vertically by one ( which gets rid of the bottom orange ) 55 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1] 56 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1] 57 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1] 58 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1] 59 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1] 60 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1] 61 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1] 62 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1] 63 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1] 64 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-1] 65 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1] 66 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1] 67 : Builder_B25 : like that ? 68 : Architect_A10 : get rid of the very bottom orange 69 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 70 : Builder_B25 : ok 71 : Architect_A10 : okay . now move to the grid space on the ground that is two to the right of that . you can create a similar stack where the floating blocks are 3 above the ground and 5 above the ground 72 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1] 73 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1] 74 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1] 75 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1] 76 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1] 77 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1] 78 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-1] 79 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1] 80 : Builder_B25 : like that ? 81 : Architect_A10 : yea 82 : Builder_B25 : is this the stack overflow logo 83 : Architect_A10 : idk i haven't seen it 84 : Builder_B25 : oh ok , is that it ? 85 : Architect_A10 : yee
