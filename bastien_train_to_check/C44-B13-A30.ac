 0 : Builder_B13 : Mission has started . 1 : Architect_A30 : ok this one is complicated so im sorry in advance 2 : Builder_B13 : that's ok . 3 : Architect_A30 : ok in the middle of the board place four blue blocks in a row 4 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0] 5 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0] 6 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0] 7 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0] 8 : Architect_A30 : ok now on the end blocks build two more blue blocks up 9 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0] 10 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0] 11 : Architect_A30 : on both sides 12 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0] 13 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0] 14 : Architect_A30 : now connect those two towers to form a box 15 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0] 16 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 17 : Architect_A30 : now along side that top row build a row of 4 purple blocks overhanging 18 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1] 19 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1] 20 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1] 21 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1] 22 : Architect_A30 : now overhanging those will be 2 more purple blocks in the center 23 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2] 24 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2] 25 : Architect_A30 : ok now you will need to remove the 2 purple blocks attaching the outermost blocks to the blue square so the middle 2 of the row of 4 purple 26 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1] 27 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1] 28 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1] 29 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 30 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 31 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1] 32 : Architect_A30 : ok now on the other side from the purple build a row of 3 yellow blocks starting o nthe left 33 : Builder_B13 : should I start them below where I am now , overhanging the blue structure ? 34 : Architect_A30 : yes they should overhang the blue structure 35 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1] 36 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1] 37 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1] 38 : Architect_A30 : now make 2 more rows of yellow blocks on top of that 39 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:4 Z:1] 40 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:5 Z:1] 41 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1] 42 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:1] 43 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1] 44 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1] 45 : Architect_A30 : ok now overhanging those will be more yellow blocks 46 : Builder_B13 : another grid of nine attached to the existing yellow grid ? 47 : Architect_A30 : yes 48 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:2] 49 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:5 Z:2] 50 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:5 Z:2] 51 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:4 Z:2] 52 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:4 Z:2] 53 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:2] 54 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2] 55 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2] 56 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2] 57 : Architect_A30 : ok and then add one row of overhangin yellow blocks to the top row 58 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:3] 59 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:5 Z:3] 60 : Builder_B13 : I 'm missing another yellow block ... 61 : Architect_A30 : ok delete the furthest out bottom row of yellow 62 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2] 63 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2] 64 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2] 65 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:5 Z:3] 66 : Architect_A30 : and then also the left two on the bottom row 67 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2] 68 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2] 69 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1] 70 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1] 71 : Architect_A30 : now only keep the middle yellow block out of the next lowest row 72 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:2] 73 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:4 Z:2] 74 : Architect_A30 : yes and delete all others in line with that one 75 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1] 76 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:4 Z:1] 77 : Architect_A30 : including the one behind it 78 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1] 79 : Architect_A30 : now delete the entire top tier except the furthest block in line diagonally with the others you have kept 80 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:5 Z:3] 81 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:5 Z:3] 82 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:5 Z:2] 83 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:5 Z:1] 84 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1] 85 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:1] 86 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:2] 87 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:5 Z:2] 88 : Architect_A30 : yes and now you will need to replicate the lower 2 yellow blocks with green blocks so build an overhanging green cube 89 : Builder_B13 : here on the same side with the yellow blocks ? 90 : Architect_A30 : yes 91 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1] 92 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:1] 93 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2] 94 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2] 95 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:2] 96 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:2] 97 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:2] 98 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2] 99 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1] 100 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2] 101 : Architect_A30 : ok i made a mistake 102 : Builder_B13 : no worries 103 : Architect_A30 : the upper green block will need to be in line with the other green block , not diagonal 104 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2] 105 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:2] 106 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:3] 107 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:3] 108 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:2] 109 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2] 110 : Architect_A30 : thats it !
