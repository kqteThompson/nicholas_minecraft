 0 : Builder_B1 : Mission has started. 1 : Builder_B1 : hello 2 : Architect_A3 : hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over 3 : Builder_B1 : take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready. 4 : Architect_A3 : ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side 5 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-1] 6 : Builder_B1 : start here? 7 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1] 8 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-1] 9 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:3 Z:-1] 10 : Architect_A3 : yes 11 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1] 12 : Builder_B1 : a C? 13 : Architect_A3 : i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle 14 : Architect_A3 : 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean 15 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1] 16 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1] 17 : Builder_B1 : so the orientation is correct? 18 : Architect_A3 : 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe 19 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1] 20 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1] 21 : Builder_B1 : like this? 22 : Architect_A3 : yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle 23 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 24 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1] 25 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1] 26 : Architect_A3 : actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed 27 : Architect_A3 : it should be a 3x4 open rectangle 28 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1] 29 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1] 30 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1] 31 : Builder_B1 : what do you mean shifted to the left? 32 : Architect_A3 : there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle 33 : Architect_A3 : it should end on the 4th block 34 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1] 35 : Architect_A3 : yes like that 36 : Builder_B1 : go it 37 : Builder_B1 : so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end? 38 : Architect_A3 : yes please 39 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 40 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1] 41 : Architect_A3 : i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one 42 : Builder_B1 : okay 43 : Architect_A3 : please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window 44 : Builder_B1 : they are connected and all look the same right? 45 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-1] 46 : Architect_A3 : some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up 47 : Builder_B1 : okay. here? 48 : Architect_A3 : this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent 49 : Builder_B1 : let me try 50 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-2] 51 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0] 52 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0] 53 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0] 54 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:0] 55 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-1] 56 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-2] 57 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-2] 58 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-2] 59 : Builder_B1 : like this? 60 : Builder_B1 : is the orientation correct? 61 : Architect_A3 : a good effort builder. we need this green one to be flat though. if you can shift it 90 degrees to the right then it will be perfect 62 : Builder_B1 : so flat? 63 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-2] 64 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-2] 65 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-2] 66 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-1] 67 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:0] 68 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0] 69 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0] 70 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0] 71 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0] 72 : Architect_A3 : yes like that 73 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-2] 74 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2] 75 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2] 76 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0] 77 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1] 78 : Architect_A3 : perfect. good job builder! 79 : Architect_A3 : one moment while i examine the strcuture 80 : Builder_B1 : okay 81 : Architect_A3 : next we need a purple r-window. it should be interlinked with the green and extending away from you. this one is not flat, much like the blue one 82 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2] 83 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2] 84 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1] 85 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1] 86 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 87 : Architect_A3 : yes like that 88 : Builder_B1 : extending like this? 89 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1] 90 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2] 91 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2] 92 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2] 93 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1] 94 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0] 95 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 96 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1] 97 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1] 98 : Architect_A3 : very good builder 99 : Builder_B1 : is that it? 100 : Builder_B1 : it might have been easier to describe the two windows first 101 : Builder_B1 : that are perpendicular 102 : Builder_B1 : then the interlocking one.. 103 : Architect_A3 : a good point builder, i will try to do better in the future. our last r-window is red and oriented like the green one (flat). it should be interlinked with the purple r-window. it should extend to the left from where you are now 104 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1] 105 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1] 106 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1] 107 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2] 108 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:3] 109 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:3] 110 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:1] 111 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:2] 112 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:3] 113 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:3] 114 : Builder_B1 : like this? 115 : Architect_A3 : good job builder, that looks correct. please allow a moment to inspect the full structure 116 : Builder_B1 : okay 117 : Architect_A3 : i do believe we have successfully completed our mission. good job builder! 118 : Builder_B1 : good job 119 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:3] 120 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:3]
