 0 : Builder_B20 : Mission has started. 1 : Architect_A10 : so this entire structure lays on/above a footprint of a 7 by 6 gird 2 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-3] 3 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2] 4 : Builder_B20 : im just marking for myself 5 : Architect_A10 : actually, that is a really good start 6 : Architect_A10 : start from the top blck and make a row toward the other of four purple blocks 7 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:2] 8 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1] 9 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0] 10 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1] 11 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2] 12 : Architect_A10 : fill in underthat as well. 13 : Builder_B20 : tok 14 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2] 15 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1] 16 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0] 17 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1] 18 : Architect_A10 : and another row on top of that of purple 19 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2] 20 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1] 21 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0] 22 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1] 23 : Architect_A10 : and you can remove taht other one 24 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-3] 25 : Architect_A10 : okay. so on right end of the strucure, on the second level, there are red blocks kind of making a ring off the end. So i would start with a red block second from the right on the second levle of this purple thing 26 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0] 27 : Architect_A10 : one more in the same direction 28 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0] 29 : Architect_A10 : lay two to the right of that 30 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1] 31 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-2] 32 : Architect_A10 : now three going up from that 33 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2] 34 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2] 35 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2] 36 : Architect_A10 : and two more wrapping around the purple 37 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1] 38 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0] 39 : Architect_A10 : yep! next lets do the green blocks. 40 : Architect_A10 : okay, so basically the same thing happens on the second level with the green. except the ring is bigger on your side 41 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:1] 42 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:1] 43 : Architect_A10 : yep! 44 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:2] 45 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:3] 46 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:3] 47 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:3] 48 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1] 49 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2] 50 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:3] 51 : Architect_A10 : okay, quick change. the blocks you can't "see" in the original purple rectangle shouldnt be there. 52 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1] 53 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0] 54 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0] 55 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1] 56 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0] 57 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1] 58 : Architect_A10 : or, morethey should be replaced with red and green to continue the rectangles youre building around them 59 : Builder_B20 : ah okay 60 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1] 61 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0] 62 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1] 63 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1] 64 : Architect_A10 : great! 65 : Architect_A10 : the final is a blue rectangle, like the ones you just build 66 : Architect_A10 : *built 67 : Builder_B20 : where do I put it? 68 : Architect_A10 : it is perpindicular to the purple and green 69 : Architect_A10 : so start in the empty spot of the green rectangle, 70 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:2] 71 : Architect_A10 : one blue on top of that 72 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2] 73 : Architect_A10 : three more toward you 74 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:2] 75 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:3 Z:2] 76 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-5 Y:3 Z:2] 77 : Architect_A10 : two down 78 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-5 Y:2 Z:2] 79 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:2] 80 : Builder_B20 : fill in the rest? or is it a ring? 81 : Architect_A10 : and then connect itwith three more back toward the start 82 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:2] 83 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:2] 84 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:2] 85 : Builder_B20 : cool 86 : Architect_A10 : done
