 0 : Builder_B1 : Mission has started. 1 : Builder_B1 : hello 2 : Architect_A4 : hi; this one is pretty complicated 3 : Architect_A4 : start with blue 4 : Architect_A4 : towards the edge 5 : Architect_A4 : place three on top of each other 6 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:5] 7 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:5] 8 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:5] 9 : Builder_B1 : anywhere is fine? 10 : Architect_A4 : yeah that's good; delete the bottom one 11 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:5] 12 : Builder_B1 : done 13 : Architect_A4 : build one next to the top one 14 : Architect_A4 : towards the center 15 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:4] 16 : Architect_A4 : one on top of that 17 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:4 Z:4] 18 : Architect_A4 : one more next to the newest one 19 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:4] 20 : Builder_B1 : here? 21 : Architect_A4 : next to it not on top 22 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:4 Z:3] 23 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:4] 24 : Architect_A4 : good 25 : Architect_A4 : you'll make that same structure two more times 26 : Architect_A4 : second one is almost directly above the first 27 : Builder_B1 : okay. what color? 28 : Architect_A4 : blue still; start in the middle column, build up three blocks 29 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:4] 30 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:6 Z:4] 31 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:7 Z:4] 32 : Builder_B1 : like this? 33 : Architect_A4 : good; delete the middle one 34 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:6 Z:4] 35 : Architect_A4 : the other middle one 36 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:6 Z:4] 37 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:4] 38 : Architect_A4 : good; just make the same structure as below it 39 : Builder_B1 : okay 40 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:7 Z:3] 41 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:8 Z:3] 42 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:8 Z:2] 43 : Builder_B1 : like this? 44 : Architect_A4 : yep 45 : Architect_A4 : now the third one is farther away 46 : Builder_B1 : still blue? 47 : Architect_A4 : look at the tip of the second "m" 48 : Architect_A4 : still blue 49 : Architect_A4 : two blank spaces towards the center then one space to the right 50 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0] 51 : Builder_B1 : here? 52 : Architect_A4 : one more towards the center 53 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0] 54 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1] 55 : Architect_A4 : good 56 : Architect_A4 : build a tower straight up 57 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1] 58 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1] 59 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1] 60 : Builder_B1 : how big? 61 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-1] 62 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-1] 63 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:7 Z:-1] 64 : Architect_A4 : there 65 : Builder_B1 : 7? 66 : Architect_A4 : it's hard to tell; the thing is just floating 67 : Builder_B1 : are the tops aligned? 68 : Architect_A4 : the third one's top is one taller than the second one 69 : Builder_B1 : by how much? 70 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:8 Z:-1] 71 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:9 Z:-1] 72 : Architect_A4 : make the top of your tower the starting block then make the same structure 73 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:9 Z:-2] 74 : Architect_A4 : oops you added more 75 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:7 Z:-1] 76 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-1] 77 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-1] 78 : Architect_A4 : the top of your tower lines up with the middle row of the second "m" 79 : Builder_B1 : wait so the 7th block was the start right? 80 : Architect_A4 : yep 81 : Builder_B1 : so that should be okay? 82 : Architect_A4 : it needs to move down one space 83 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:7 Z:-1] 84 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:8 Z:-2] 85 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:9 Z:-1] 86 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:9 Z:-3] 87 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1] 88 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1] 89 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1] 90 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1] 91 : Builder_B1 : is this okay? 92 : Architect_A4 : yes great 93 : Builder_B1 : good 94 : Architect_A4 : now switch to orange 95 : Architect_A4 : look at the shadows of two structures 96 : Architect_A4 : the one with four spaces 97 : Architect_A4 : move two spaces to the left 98 : Architect_A4 : on the opposite side of the third structure 99 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1] 100 : Architect_A4 : in line with the four shadows 101 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1] 102 : Builder_B1 : where should i stand? 103 : Architect_A4 : there is good 104 : Architect_A4 : leave two blank spaces, then place an orange block 105 : Architect_A4 : such that it lines up with the top of the shadows 106 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:2] 107 : Architect_A4 : great 108 : Builder_B1 : ok 109 : Architect_A4 : now build a tower straight up 110 : Architect_A4 : line up with the top of the second structure 111 : Builder_B1 : it might be easier to connect the stuctures from before? 112 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:2] 113 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:2] 114 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:2] 115 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:2] 116 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:2] 117 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:7 Z:2] 118 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:8 Z:2] 119 : Architect_A4 : there's no connection though 120 : Architect_A4 : build one more up 121 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:9 Z:2] 122 : Architect_A4 : delete all but the top three 123 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:2] 124 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:2] 125 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:2] 126 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:2] 127 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:2] 128 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:2] 129 : Architect_A4 : rotate 90 degrees and face the orange line 130 : Architect_A4 : okay; put three more orange blocks to the right of that 131 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:9 Z:1] 132 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:9 Z:0] 133 : Architect_A4 : you're making a flat 3x3 square 134 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:9 Z:-1] 135 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:9 Z:-1] 136 : Builder_B1 : here? 137 : Architect_A4 : yes; fill in any gaps below it 138 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:8 Z:1] 139 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:8 Z:0] 140 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:7 Z:1] 141 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:7 Z:0] 142 : Architect_A4 : great all done 143 : Builder_B1 : good
