 0 : Builder_B40 : Mission has started . hi 1 : Architect_A14 : You can start this one somewhat in the center , but it goes mostly upwards . Place a red block first 2 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0] 3 : Architect_A14 : Sorry I meant orange . It looked more like red at first ! 4 : Builder_B40 : np 5 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0] 6 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0] 7 : Architect_A14 : Now place one diagonally below it 8 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1] 9 : Architect_A14 : Great ! Now place another one diagonal to the first one , on the right 10 : Builder_B40 : again below it right ? 11 : Architect_A14 : Yup ! 12 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1] 13 : Architect_A14 : Great . Now place an orange block in the middle of those two blocks 14 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 15 : Architect_A14 : And then place one right below the one you just placed 16 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2] 17 : Builder_B40 : you could 've said a plus sign ;) 18 : Architect_A14 : Great , now stack an orange block on top of the center one 19 : Builder_B40 : but no problem 20 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1] 21 : Architect_A14 : Haha I didn't realize there was a center block until she pointed it out You can't really see it here 22 : Builder_B40 : ah i see ! true 23 : Architect_A14 : Okay now put another orange block on top of that 24 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1] 25 : Architect_A14 : We're going to build a square around this block using green blocks 26 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2] 27 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2] 28 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1] 29 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 30 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0] 31 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0] 32 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1] 33 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-2] 34 : Builder_B40 : like this ? 35 : Architect_A14 : yes , great ! now place another orange block on top of the center one 36 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1] 37 : Architect_A14 : Sorry place another orange block on top of this one 38 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1] 39 : Builder_B40 : another square around this one ? 40 : Architect_A14 : Great , now we're going to make a plus sign with green blocks plus sign this time ! 41 : Builder_B40 : cool center of the plus on top of the last orange block i placed ? 42 : Architect_A14 : The orange block is the center sorry 43 : Builder_B40 : ah got it 44 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-2] 45 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-1] 46 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0] 47 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-1] 48 : Builder_B40 : like this ? or is the plus bigger ? 49 : Architect_A14 : Yes perfect ! now stack two yellow blocks on top of the orange one in the center , but remove the first one so there's just one floating on top 50 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1] 51 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-1] 52 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1] 53 : Architect_A14 : Awesome ! Ok there are a few random blocks left to place here and there There is a red block jutting out on the left side next to the orange block standing by itself 54 : Builder_B40 : which orange block ? 55 : Architect_A14 : I think it's the third one from down wait fourth one 56 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1] 57 : Builder_B40 : like this ? 58 : Architect_A14 : Yes except it's right next to that one . So place another one to the left and then remove this one 59 : Builder_B40 : gotcha ya that's why i was a bit confused 60 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-1] 61 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1] 62 : Architect_A14 : yeah sorry ! Ok now we're going to do the same thing with a purple block 63 : Builder_B40 : np 64 : Architect_A14 : Place one above the orange block on the right side of the plus sign at the bottom You're standing in the right spot 65 : Builder_B40 : ya not sure which place you mean 66 : Architect_A14 : Sorry so the base of the structure is a plus right . Place a purple block on top of the right orange block of the plus sign Stack it , I mean 67 : Builder_B40 : right orange block of the pus sign ? plus * 68 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-1] 69 : Builder_B40 : you mean here ? 70 : Architect_A14 : No you have to go all the way to the bottom 71 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-1] 72 : Builder_B40 : oh this plus sign !! i thought the green one ! lol forgot there were two plus signs 73 : Architect_A14 : No worries ! 74 : Builder_B40 : ya that's why i didn't understand when you said base of the structure 75 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1] 76 : Builder_B40 : here ? 77 : Architect_A14 : Yeah sorry i may have forgotton to say orange plus yes . Now place a purple one to the right of this one and then remove this one 78 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1] 79 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1] 80 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1] 81 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1] 82 : Architect_A14 : Great ! now go the left side of the plus sign . And place a blue block two squares above the one directly next to the orange block sorry that was confusing 83 : Builder_B40 : haha np 84 : Architect_A14 : so on the left side of the plus , instead of placing the blue block directly next to the orange one , place it two squares above , 85 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1] 86 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1] 87 : Architect_A14 : I don't know if that helps either lol 88 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1] 89 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1] 90 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1] 91 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2] 92 : Builder_B40 : like this ? not sure if that's right 93 : Architect_A14 : It has to be down next to the base structure 94 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1] 95 : Architect_A14 : like on the ground 96 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:1] 97 : Builder_B40 : here ? 98 : Architect_A14 : Yes that's right , but it's on the wrong side sorry . We want it on the side opposite the random purple block 99 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:1] 100 : Builder_B40 : so this side ... 101 : Architect_A14 : yes 102 : Builder_B40 : now two squares above which block exactly ? 103 : Architect_A14 : So maybe it's easier if I tell you to place it somewhere first and then move it . Place it on the ground next to the orange block 104 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1] 105 : Architect_A14 : Yes now move it to the left by two squares 106 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1] 107 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1] 108 : Builder_B40 : here ? 109 : Architect_A14 : yes , great ! now place another blue block on top of it 110 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:2 Z:1] 111 : Builder_B40 : phew :) 112 : Architect_A14 : Now remove the bottom blue one 113 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1] 114 : Architect_A14 : and we're done ! phew 115 : Builder_B40 : haha cool
