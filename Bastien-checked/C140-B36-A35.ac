19 : Architect_A35 : each block place behind that block horizontal 20 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:0] 21 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:1 Z:0] 22 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0] 23 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0] 24 : Builder_B36 : like this ? 25 : Architect_A35 : other way 26 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:0] 27 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:1 Z:0] 28 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0] 29 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0] 30 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:0] 31 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:1] 32 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:2] 33 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:3] 34 : Builder_B36 : like this 35 : Architect_A35 : yeah 36 : Builder_B36 : ? ok 37 : Architect_A35 : now do the same thing 1 block to the right of that 1 38 : Builder_B36 : am i facing your forward or your right right now ? 39 : Architect_A35 : so there should be a space between the two columns 40 : Builder_B36 : ok 41 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:3] 42 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:2] 43 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1] 44 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0] 45 : Architect_A35 : after that , do the same thing again 46 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:3] 47 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2] 48 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1] 49 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0] 50 : Architect_A35 : okay now move 1 block forward in the gap above the two columns place a purple block above the empty space 51 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:4] 52 : Builder_B36 : like this ? 53 : Architect_A35 : it should be above the orange block 54 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:4] 55 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:4] 56 : Builder_B36 : like this ? 57 : Architect_A35 : 1 second I 'm going to rephrase it 58 : Builder_B36 : or do you want me to connect the columns 59 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:4] 60 : Architect_A35 : connect the columns 61 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:3] 62 : Builder_B36 : like this ? 63 : Architect_A35 : do that for the block underneath that 1 64 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:3] 65 : Architect_A35 : so 2 blocks 66 : Builder_B36 : like this ? 67 : Architect_A35 : in each empty space 68 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2] 69 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1] 70 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0] 71 : Builder_B36 : like filling in the gaps ? 72 : Architect_A35 : remove the last 2 blocks u placed 73 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0] 74 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1] 75 : Architect_A35 : okay now build vertically in the Z direction those 2 purple blocks should be floating above its not all flat 76 : Builder_B36 : oh ok 77 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:2 Z:3] 78 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2] 79 : Architect_A35 : like that 80 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:3] 81 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2] 82 : Builder_B36 : like this ? 83 : Architect_A35 : do the same for the other 1 84 : Builder_B36 : ok 85 : Architect_A35 : but yeah 86 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:3] 87 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:3] 88 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:3] 89 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:3] 90 : Builder_B36 : good ? 91 : Architect_A35 : yeah but that 2nd purple column should have 1 more block 92 : Builder_B36 : ok 93 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:2] 94 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:2] 95 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:2] 96 : Builder_B36 : like this ? 97 : Architect_A35 : there's 3 blocks in that column . delete the one underneath I think you double place 98 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:3] 99 : Architect_A35 : ok good 100 : Builder_B36 : o sorry 101 : Architect_A35 : no worries oka so now move to the other empty column yeah now using yellow place 2 blocks in the empty space . 1 block should connect the orange columns and the other should be just underneath them 102 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2] 103 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1] 104 : Builder_B36 : like this ? 105 : Architect_A35 : no 106 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1] 107 : Architect_A35 : so you know how you're facing the bottom of the columns 108 : Builder_B36 : o ok 109 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0] 110 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1] 111 : Architect_A35 : yeah 112 : Builder_B36 : ok cool 113 : Architect_A35 : okay now do that again but to the right of the orange column also don't keep moving your cam , it messes our reference not there , other side 114 : Builder_B36 : o sorry here ? 115 : Architect_A35 : yeah 116 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0] 117 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1] 118 : Architect_A35 : okay now do that again to the right 119 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0] 120 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1] 121 : Architect_A35 : should like the 3 orange columns 122 : Builder_B36 : like this ? 123 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1] 124 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0] 125 : Architect_A35 : to the right 1 more space 126 : Builder_B36 : my right ? 127 : Architect_A35 : yeah 1 more 128 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0] 129 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1] 130 : Architect_A35 : no 1 more to the right 131 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0] 132 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0] 133 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0] 134 : Architect_A35 : do the same thing , but 1 more row to the right 135 : Builder_B36 : same thing as the yellow blocks or orange blocks ? 136 : Architect_A35 : there should be a space between the last yellow column you made and the next yellow 1 you will make 137 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1] 138 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1] 139 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1] 140 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0] 141 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-1] 142 : Architect_A35 : yes 143 : Builder_B36 : like this ? ok 144 : Architect_A35 : okay now similar to what we did with the purple use blue and place them vertical in the empty space between the yellow . 1 block should be on the bottom of the yellow , and 1 should hang dont move 145 : Builder_B36 : ok 146 : Architect_A35 : so from where you're standing the blocks in front of you building up should be : empty space , blue 147 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1] 148 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1] 149 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1] 150 : Architect_A35 : yes 151 : Builder_B36 : ok 152 : Architect_A35 : now build 1 block in front of that 153 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2] 154 : Builder_B36 : like this ? 155 : Architect_A35 : yeas 156 : Builder_B36 : ok cool 157 : Architect_A35 : now do the same thing for the other yellow space on ur left 158 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 159 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1] 160 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 161 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2] 162 : Builder_B36 : like this ? 163 : Architect_A35 : yeah I need u to go back to the side with purple and 1 block that hangs of the edge on each of them like how you did with the blue in purple 164 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:2 Z:4] 165 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:4] 166 : Architect_A35 : yeah 167 : Builder_B36 : ok 168 : Architect_A35 : sorry that was hard to explain . But we're done 169 : Builder_B36 : nice !
