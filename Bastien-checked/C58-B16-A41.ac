Put down a line of five blue blocks close a few square away from the corner of the environment . 2 : Builder_B16 : here ? the outlined area ? 3 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:1 Z:2] 4 : Architect_A41 : Sorry , typo lol . Yeah that's good . Parallel to the edge of the environment 5 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:2] 6 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2] 7 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2] 8 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2] 9 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:2] 10 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:2] 11 : Architect_A41 : Okay . Now two yellow blocks , parallel to the blue blocks . on the side closest to you and closest to the edge of the environment . 12 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1] 13 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1] 14 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1] 15 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1] 16 : Builder_B16 : this ? 17 : Architect_A41 : Should be on the left side , sorry . 18 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0] 19 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0] 20 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1] 21 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1] 22 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:1] 23 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1] 24 : Architect_A41 : cool . Now one more yellow block to the left of those two 25 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:1 Z:1] 26 : Architect_A41 : Perfect . Now a row of two yellow blocks , one on top of the yellow block that's sticking out , and one next to that one . 27 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:2 Z:1] 28 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:2 Z:1] 29 : Builder_B16 : this ? 30 : Architect_A41 : yep perfect now delete the yellow block on the bottom , closest to the edge of the environment 31 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:4 Y:1 Z:1] 32 : Architect_A41 : cool . now fill in the rest of that row with three blue blocks on the ground , parallel to the other blue blocks 33 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1] 34 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1] 35 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1] 36 : Architect_A41 : Great ! 37 : Builder_B16 : sorry , that took a minute ! 38 : Architect_A41 : Yeah sorry my instruction was ambiguous haha Okay , now adjacent to the middle blue block that you just laid down You are going to build the same yellow structure that you did before 39 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0] 40 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 41 : Architect_A41 : It will be perpendicular to the other yellow structure 42 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0] 43 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1] 44 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0] 45 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2] 46 : Architect_A41 : And the dangling part faces away from the blue blocks 47 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2] 48 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2] 49 : Architect_A41 : Perfect ! Okay now fill in blue blocks on the ground so that the blocks on the ground form a rectangle . It will be 4 blocks by 5 blocks . 50 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:1 Z:1] 51 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:1 Z:0] 52 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-1] 53 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-2] 54 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-3] 55 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-3] 56 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3] 57 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-3] 58 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-3] 59 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3] 60 : Architect_A41 : Sorry , the dangling bits will hang over the edges of the rectangle 61 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-3] 62 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-3] 63 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-2] 64 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2] 65 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2] 66 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2] 67 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2] 68 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-2] 69 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-2] 70 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-1] 71 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:4 Y:1 Z:0] 72 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:4 Y:1 Z:1] 73 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:1 Z:0] 74 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1] 75 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-2] 76 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2] 77 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:1 Z:1] 78 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:1 Z:0] 79 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-1] 80 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-2] 81 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2] 82 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2] 83 : Architect_A41 : So fill in the space between the two yellow shapes first 84 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0] 85 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0] 86 : Architect_A41 : Fill in that gap with blue 87 : Builder_B16 : I can't ? It doesn't seem like there is anymore blue . Do I remove a portion already built ? 88 : Architect_A41 : Oh yeah . Remove the rows that go underneath the dangling yellow parts 89 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2] 90 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2] 91 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2] 92 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-2] 93 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-2] 94 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:4 Y:1 Z:0] 95 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-1] 96 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:4 Y:1 Z:1] 97 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1] 98 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1] 99 : Architect_A41 : Okay great 100 : Builder_B16 : That was rough , sorry 101 : Architect_A41 : Now just fill in two blocks next to the yellow thing So the whole base forms a rectangle No worries , this is a weird one 102 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0] 103 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1] 104 : Architect_A41 : Yay we did it !!
